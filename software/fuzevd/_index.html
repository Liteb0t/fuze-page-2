				<h2>FuzeVD - Video Downloader</h2>
				<p>
				Input a Youtube (and sometimes other sites!) <abbr title="You know what a URL is, right?">URL</abbr> and download into a format of your choice.<br>
				<br>
				Includes an updater, so you'll <dfn title="(lie)">never</dfn> need to reinstall to get the latest software. The only thing the updater can't update is itself...<br>

				FuzeVD uses the libraries
				<a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp">yt-dlp</a> and
				<a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a>. This is just a <abbr>GUI</abbr> wrapper for yt-dlp so for complex operations you can use the included exe, but you will need to learn some commands.<br><br>
				This program was made in Visual Basic .NET. I might eventually rewrite FuzeVD using a different toolkit, most likely the <a href="https://www.qt.io/product/framework">QT framework</a>, since i found .NET 6 <dfn title="Didn't microsoft used to make good software? How the mighty have fallen.">too buggy to work with</dfn>. FuzeVD is on .NET Framework 4.7.2 which is good however staying on such an old framework for too long might lead to problems down the road.
